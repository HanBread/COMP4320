The brisk chilling air is calling
And out there we're free
To run and jump and live so wildly
Head first, we'll go tumbling
To places unknown
With nothing but the stars to light our way
And though the sun may set at night
Tomorrow looks so bright
'Cause home
Is when you're by my side
No matter what we do
Together we'll see it through
And I hope
That we won't drift apart
Even though things change
Without you it's not the same
I know it's true
Life's better
When it's me and you
