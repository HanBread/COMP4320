Always on the outside, through a window lookin' in
Never the right time, so the chance goes by again
The lines begin to show when we feel broken
To move on we have to drop the pieces we're hoping
And no one is perfect
You don't need to be strong every single day
No one really knows along the way
That the best things in life won't be perfect anyway
Chase the wind again, knowing just what they'll say
Don't care anymore, can't stay still anyway (Ooh)
The lines begin to show, when we feel broken
